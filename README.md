# PakRat

PakRat allows you to create and save packing lists for trips.

Users can create accounts, then curate their own packing lists. Packing lists have an 'edit' and 'pack' displays, and items can be sorted into subcategories for ease of use. When editing a list users can add items and quantities of those items. When packin users can check off items as they pack them.
